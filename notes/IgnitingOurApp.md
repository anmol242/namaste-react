## What is package.json?

Package.json file is a configuration for our npm. It contains information about our project and the dependencies that it needs to run.

## Why we need package.json?

We need package.json to manage our project dependencies. It allows us to define the dependencies that our project needs to run. It also allows us to define the scripts that we can run in our project. It also allows us to define the version of our packages.

## What is bundler?

Bundler basically bundles our code so that it will be production ready. It will also minify our code so that it will be smaller in size. It will also allow us to use ES6 features in our code. Webpack, Parcel and Vite are some of the bundlers that we can use.
